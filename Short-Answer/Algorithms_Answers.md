#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

`O(1) + O(1) + O(n) * O(1)`

`= O(2) + O(n)`

`= O(n)`

Runtime is `Linear`. It takes as long as the value of n is increased by n * n * n to run

b)

`O(1) + O(n) + O(1) + O(logn) + O(1) + O(1)`

`= O(4) + O(n) + O(logn)`

`= O(nlogn)`

Runtime is `Logarithmic`. It takes as long as the value of n is increased by n and log of itself as a result of the increasing value of `j` in while loop.

c)

`O(1) + O(1) + O(n)`

`= O(2) + O(n)`

`=O(n)`

Runtime is `Linear`. It takes as long as the value of n to run.

## Exercise II

`O(14) + O(logn)`
`= O(logn)`

Runtime is `Logarithmic`. It takes as long as the value of n is increased by log of itself as a result of the decreasing value of `middle` in while loop.
